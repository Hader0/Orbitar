    "goalType": "Analyze adoption trends from the user's data to identify where on the adoption curve things stand, what's driving or blocking growth, and where adoption is heading.",
    "contextHints": "Adoption data, user counts, and growth metrics MUST come from user notes and FILE:/IMAGE: attachments—never invent specific numbers or growth rates. From attachments containing usage charts, signup data, cohort analyses, or market penetration estimates, extract the adoption trajectory and any inflection points. Identify the time periods covered and any gaps in the data. Note external events (launches, market changes, competitor moves) that correlate with adoption shifts. Capture the adopter segments if mentioned: early adopters vs mainstream vs laggards.",
    "outputHints": "Structure as: Adoption Summary (current state and trajectory in one paragraph), Historical Pattern (what the data shows over time, with specific periods), Inflection Points (moments where adoption accelerated or stalled, with hypothesized causes), Adoption Drivers (what's pushing adoption forward, with evidence), Adoption Barriers (what's slowing adoption, with evidence), Segment Analysis (if data supports: which segments are adopting faster/slower), Leading Indicators (early signals that predict future adoption), Trajectory Scenarios (where adoption could go: accelerating, plateauing, or declining case with assumptions), and Strategic Implications (what to do based on where we are on the curve).",
    "qualityRules": "Adoption claims must be grounded in the provided data; don't assert 'hockey stick growth' without evidence. Inflection points need both identification and hypothesized explanation. Distinguish between correlation and causation when linking events to adoption changes. Scenarios must include explicit assumptions that would make each scenario occur. If the data only covers a short period, acknowledge limitations in projecting trends. The analysis should help someone decide how to accelerate adoption or respond to stalling growth."

    "goalType": "Analyze pricing and revenue trends from the user's data to identify trajectory, pricing power dynamics, and implications for monetization strategy.",
    "contextHints": "Pricing data, revenue figures, and monetization details MUST come from user notes and FILE:/IMAGE: attachments—never invent specific prices or revenue numbers. From attachments containing pricing history, revenue charts, competitive pricing, or deal data, extract the pricing trajectory and any significant changes. Note the time periods and any market events that correlate with pricing shifts. Identify pricing model changes (one-time to subscription, freemium introduction, etc.) if mentioned. Capture competitive pricing context if provided.",
    "outputHints": "Structure as: Pricing/Revenue Summary (current state and direction), Historical Trajectory (how prices or revenue have moved over time), Key Shifts (significant changes with timing and context), Market Dynamics (what's driving pricing power up or down), Competitive Pricing Context (how pricing compares to alternatives, if data provided), Pricing Model Evolution (changes in how value is captured), Leading Indicators (signals that predict future pricing trends), Trajectory Scenarios (where pricing/revenue could go with assumptions), Margin Implications (if cost data available), and Strategic Recommendations (pricing actions based on the trends).",
    "qualityRules": "Never fabricate specific prices or revenue figures not in the data. Distinguish between list prices and actual transaction prices if both are available. Pricing power claims need evidence: are customers paying more over time, or is discounting increasing? If analyzing competitive pricing, note data freshness and completeness. Scenarios should include the market conditions that would drive each outcome. The analysis should inform pricing decisions, not just describe what happened."

From attachments containing product roadmaps, release histories, technical benchmarks, or capability comparisons over time, extract the evolution pattern.

Note the time periods and any external factors (new standards, platform changes, breakthrough research) that correlate with capability jumps. Capture the competitive technology landscape if provided.",
    "outputHints": "Structure as: Technology Summary (current state of the technology/capability), Evolution Timeline (how capabilities have changed over time, with specific periods), Capability Trajectory (what's improving, at what rate), Maturity Assessment (where on the maturity curve: emerging, growing, mature, declining), Driving Forces (what's pushing the technology forward), Adoption Patterns (how usage is evolving alongside capability), Emerging Directions (where the technology appears to be heading based on signals), Disruption Risks (technologies that could displace current approaches), Scenario Projections (capability levels in future periods with assumptions), and Strategic Implications (build, buy, wait, or abandon recommendations).",
    "qualityRules": "Technology capability claims must be grounded in the provided data; don't assert 'exponential improvement' without evidence. Distinguish between demonstrated capabilities and announced roadmaps. Maturity assessments should use explicit criteria. If comparing technologies, ensure comparisons are apples-to-apples on the same metrics. Disruption risks should be based on signals in the data, not generic technology hype. The analysis should help someone make technology investment or adoption decisions."

From attachments containing incident timelines, churn cohorts, error logs, or risk assessments, extract the trend pattern and any anomalies.

    "qualityRules": "Risk claims must be grounded in the provided data; don't catastrophize or minimize without evidence. Distinguish between incident frequency and severity; both matter differently. Correlation is not causation—be careful attributing root causes without strong evidence. If data shows improving trends, acknowledge it; risk analysis isn't only about finding problems. Leading indicators must be genuinely predictive based on the data, not assumed. The analysis should help someone prioritize risk mitigation efforts effectively."

    "contextHints": "Trend data and signals MUST come from user notes and FILE:/IMAGE: attachments. From attachments containing historical data, forecasts, or qualitative signals, identify the key uncertainties that could drive different futures. Note which trends seem stable vs volatile. Identify the critical uncertainties: factors that are both highly impactful and genuinely uncertain. Capture any existing assumptions or forecasts the user has that should be stress-tested.",
    "outputHints": "Structure as: Trend Foundation (what the data shows about current trajectory), Critical Uncertainties (2-3 key factors that could drive different outcomes, with why they're uncertain), Scenario Framework (the axes or dimensions that define the scenario space), Scenario Descriptions (3-4 distinct scenarios: optimistic, baseline, pessimistic, and optionally a wildcard), For Each Scenario: narrative description, key assumptions, probability assessment (if possible), early indicators that this scenario is emerging, and strategic implications, Robust Strategies (actions that make sense across multiple scenarios), Scenario-Specific Strategies (actions contingent on which scenario emerges), and Monitoring Plan (what to watch to detect which scenario is unfolding).",
    "qualityRules": "Scenarios must be plausible given the data, not arbitrary. Critical uncertainties should be genuinely uncertain, not things we can predict confidently. Each scenario needs internal consistency; don't mix incompatible assumptions. Probability assessments should be honest about uncertainty; false precision is worse than ranges. Early indicators must be observable and timely enough to act on. The analysis should help someone prepare for multiple futures rather than over-commit to one prediction."
