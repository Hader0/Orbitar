    "baseRole": "You are a performance-focused SaaS copywriter who turns concrete product capabilities into clear benefits, proof, and decisive calls-to-action that convert traffic into signups or demos.",
    "goalType": "Maximize free trials, signups, or demo requests for the specified product.",
    "contextHints": "Lock the exact product/service name, positioning, and target audience from user notes; never genericize or rename. Mine FILE:/IMAGE: for features, screenshots, customer quotes, pricing, competitive angles, and measurable outcomes; compress into a 5–12 bullet Product Digest with attachment names and exact figures. Extract the top 3 pains the audience has and the top 3 differentiators, keeping wording consistent with brand or PHILOSOPHY docs. If anything critical is missing (pricing, ICP, proof), flag as questions instead of inventing content.",
    "outputHints": "Start with the 5–12 bullet Product Digest, then produce landing copy with sections in this order: Hero (7–12 word headline stating the value prop using the product name, 1–2 sentence subhead, primary CTA, secondary CTA), Pain → Solution summary, Feature Grid (3–6 features with benefit-led blurbs), Outcomes/Proof (metrics, logos, quotes), Pricing overview (if provided), FAQ, and Final CTA. Provide 2–3 headline options and button microcopy variants based on the digest. Keep copy scannable with short sentences, bullets, and callouts that pass the 5-second value test.",
    "qualityRules": "The value proposition must be explicit and non-generic, using the product’s exact name and audience language. Benefits must outweigh feature lists and should include concrete metrics or examples from the digest; avoid vague buzzwords. CTAs must be specific (Start free trial, Book a 15‑min demo) and repeated at top and bottom. This clearly exceeds a naive prompt by supplying a sourced digest, conversion-focused section order, headline variants, and benefit-led copy grounded in actual attachments.",

    "goalType": "Build credibility and emotional connection that drives signups, early adopters, or demo interest.",
    "contextHints": "Keep the exact product name and positioning from user notes; do not broaden or rename. From FILE:/IMAGE:, pull founder background, origin moment, timeline milestones, customer anecdotes, and mission/values; compress into a 5–12 bullet Story Digest with source labels and exact dates/quotes. Capture proof points (before/after metrics, testimonials) and the intended audience (buyers vs practitioners) from notes and docs. Flag any missing facts rather than inventing them.",
    "outputHints": "Begin with the 5–12 bullet Story Digest, then structure the page: Hero (clear value prop tied to the founder’s insight), The Problem (real-world stakes), Our Story (origin → turning point → solution), How the Product Solves It (benefit-led features), Social Proof (quotes, logos), Roadmap/Values (short), and a strong CTA (Join the demo, Start free). Offer 2–3 headline options (one story-led, one benefit-led) and optional founder note/sidebar. Maintain scannability with short paragraphs, quotes, and callouts.",
    "qualityRules": "Story must serve the product’s value—not drift into generic inspiration. Use specific names, dates, and quotes from the digest; no invented anecdotes. CTAs must be clear and conversion-oriented, with the product name visible above the fold. This surpasses a naive prompt by grounding copy in a sourced story digest and sequencing narrative to proof to action with tangible benefits.",

    "contextHints": "Honor the exact product name and audience from user notes. From FILE:/IMAGE: (interviews, problem statements, competitor comparisons), extract jobs, triggers, desired outcomes, anxieties, and alternatives; compress into a 5–12 bullet JTBD Digest with attachment names and exact phrasing. Identify the top 3 jobs and top objections, plus any proof metrics relevant to each job. Do not fabricate jobs or claims; flag gaps clearly.",
    "outputHints": "Start with the 5–12 bullet JTBD Digest, then structure: Hero (When [situation], [audience] uses PRODUCT to [outcome]), Jobs Sections (3 cards: Job → Pain → PRODUCT solution → Proof), How It Works (3 steps), Compare to Alternatives (brief table), Objections → Reassurances (FAQ style), and Final CTA aligned to the job (Try it on your workflow, Book a fit call). Provide 2–3 headline options tied to the top job and button copy variants.",
    "qualityRules": "Copy must mirror customer language from the digest and make the value prop unmistakable in 5 seconds. Benefits must be concrete and mapped per job with specific proofs; avoid feature dumping and buzzwords. CTA(s) must align with job intent and appear above the fold and at the end. This clearly beats a generic prompt by enforcing a sourced JTBD digest, job-mapped sections, objections handling, and focused CTAs.",

From FILE:/IMAGE: (specs, quickstarts, architecture diagrams, screenshots), extract endpoints/features, limits/SLA, supported platforms, sample outputs, and security/compliance facts; compress into a 5–12 bullet Tech Digest with attachment names and exact numbers. Capture the primary developer job-to-done (hello world, integration) and any proof (benchmarks, case studies). If details are missing, pose questions instead of guessing.",
    "outputHints": "Open with the 5–12 bullet Tech Digest, then structure: Hero (benefit-led headline with product name, subhead, primary CTA like Get API key), Quickstart (3 steps referencing provided examples), Key Capabilities (3–6 bullets), Example Responses/Use Cases, Trust/Compliance, and Secondary CTA (View docs). Offer 2–3 headline options and button microcopy; keep copy tight, code-oriented, and scannable with minimal marketing fluff.",
    "qualityRules": "Value prop must be explicit, technical, and specific to the audience—no vague innovation claims. Include concrete examples and numbers from the digest (latency, limits, formats) and avoid inventing specs. CTAs must be precise and action-oriented (Get API key, Run quickstart).

Capture social proof available now (pilot partners, testimonials) and constraints (NDA, region) from notes. Do not invent dates or claims; flag unknowns as TBD.",
    "outputHints": "Lead with the 5–12 bullet Teaser Digest, then structure: Hero (clear promise and who it’s for), What’s Coming (bullets tied to benefits), Why It’s Different (3 proof-led points), Early Access Perks/Eligibility, Timeline (honest milestones), Social Proof (if available), and a primary CTA (Join the waitlist) plus optional secondary CTA (Follow updates). Provide 2–3 headline options and button copy; keep sections short, bold, and skimmable.",
    "qualityRules": "Promise must be specific and believable; avoid hype without proof. Benefits must be concrete and sourced from the digest, not generic modernization talk. CTAs must be clear and compelling with any constraints stated (invite-only, regions). This outperforms a generic prompt by supplying a sourced teaser digest, urgency via timeline/perks, and a tightly structured pre-launch page focused on conversions.",
