    "contextHints": "Infer domain and task type from the user’s top-level instruction (e.g., write, analyze, plan, compare) and reflect it verbatim in the Goal. Mine FILE:/CODE:/IMAGE: for definitions, constraints, examples, acceptance criteria, and edge cases; extract only what is explicitly present. Decide Context bullets by prioritizing factual constraints, stakeholder/audience cues, required formats, and examples directly quoted or summarized from attachments. Do not invent domain specifics; if something is missing, state it as a gap rather than fabricating.",
    "outputHints": "Build a system prompt with mandatory sections: Role, Goal, Context (3–10 bullets with quoted essentials from notes/attachments), Constraints & Guardrails, Output Contract (format/schema, sections, bounds), and Notes on Style/Tone if relevant. Phrase instructions as imperatives to the downstream model (e.g., 'Produce...', 'Do not...') and include precise formatting requirements (JSON schema, headings, length limits) as needed. Provide an 'Assumptions & Gaps' section listing unknowns the downstream model must not guess about. Do not include any full task solution; at most include 1–2 miniature, non-fulfilling examples strictly to clarify the output shape.",
    "qualityRules": "Never perform the task (no full articles, long lists, production code, or complete deliverables). On minimal input, do not invent facts; focus the Context on structure (target audience, tone, required sections) and list gaps explicitly. If attachments exist, embed their key content as 3–10 concise bullets citing the attachment name; quality fail if you mention attachments without extracting content. Keep instructions domain-agnostic and enforce a precise output contract so the downstream result is checkable. This must exceed a naive 'You are X, do Y' by supplying labeled sections, explicit constraints, and a verifiable output format.",

    "contextHints": "Infer domain/task from the user instruction and enumerate explicit constraints (policies, legal, PII, compliance) found in FILE:/IMAGE:; capture any forbidden topics or brand guardrails. From CODE:/FILE:, extract operational limits (time, cost, size), data sensitivity, accuracy thresholds, and fallback rules stated by the user. Select Context bullets that document these constraints, edge cases, and validation criteria verbatim or tightly summarized.",
    "outputHints": "Compose sections: Role, Goal, Context (3–10 bullets emphasizing constraints and edge cases), Guardrails & Prohibitions (explicit do/don’t list), Risk Scenarios & Required Behaviors (if X, then do Y), Output Contract (format + required validations), and Escalation/Fallback Steps when data is missing or risky. Instruct the downstream model to verify inputs, refuse unsafe requests per constraints, and include a brief 'Assumptions' line item if proceeding with defaults. Provide only schematic mini-examples to illustrate validation, never full task content.",
    "qualityRules": "Never perform the task yourself; examples must be minimal and non-fulfilling. On sparse input, do not add factual claims—encode unknowns as 'MISSING' and require safe defaults or refusal conditions. Always embed attachment-derived constraints and prohibitions as concrete bullets; it’s a quality fail to ignore attachments or to hand-wave safety. Keep language domain-agnostic but unambiguous about risk handling and refusal thresholds. Surpass a naive prompt by detailing guardrails, if-then behaviors, and an output contract that includes validation and safety acknowledgments.",

Use terse, telegraphic phrasing and require the downstream model to keep the final output within defined bounds. Include at most one micro-example that demonstrates the output’s shape; avoid content that would satisfy the request.",

With minimal input, do not fabricate facts—encode unknowns as 'UNKNOWN' and keep context structural (audience, sections, tone) rather than speculative content.

Write explicit rules for time-boxing, how many questions to ask, and a fallback when the user is unresponsive (assumptions list + proceed or stop). Include 1–2 tiny examples showing acceptable question style or outline shape—never the final content.",
    "qualityRules": "Do not execute the final task; the prompt must stop at producing plans/outlines or staged deliverables per the workflow. On minimal input, require the downstream model to ask targeted questions instead of inventing facts. If attachments exist, embed their key content as bullets and instruct the model to reference them explicitly in follow-ups.
