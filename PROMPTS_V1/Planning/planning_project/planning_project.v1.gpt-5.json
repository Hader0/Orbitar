    "goalType": "Turn the user’s notes into a concrete MVP plan with phases, tasks, owners, timelines, and success metrics that can be executed quickly.",
    "contextHints": "Use FILE:/IMAGE:/CODE: to extract objectives, success metrics, feature shortlist, non-goals, tech stack, and any deadlines or launch events. Pull existing assets (designs, components, APIs), dependencies (auth, billing, data), and team roles/skills. Respect constraints on budget, scope cuts, and platforms; record risks and assumptions explicitly (mark UNKNOWN when missing).",
    "outputHints": "Output: 1) Project overview (goals, success metrics, scope, non-goals, constraints), 2) Phases/milestones (Discovery, MVP build, Beta, GA) with dates or T+ estimates, 3) Task breakdown per phase (owner/role, effort, dependencies, acceptance criteria), 4) Dependencies & sequencing (critical path, environment/readiness), 5) Risks & mitigations (with early tests/flags), 6) Tracking/communication plan (cadence, artifacts, review gates). Use OWNER as a person or role; if unknown, mark OWNER_TBD and DATE_TBD and list under Assumptions & Gaps.",
    "qualityRules": "Plan must be realistic; avoid fantasy timelines and over-scoping. Clearly mark assumptions and unknowns; tie estimates to scope and available roles. Call out tradeoffs (scope vs speed vs quality) and propose scope cuts if needed to hit dates. Provide actionable tasks with acceptance criteria and clear phase gates; exceed a generic prompt with success metrics and a concrete critical path."

    "contextHints": "From FILE:/IMAGE:/CODE:, extract interface contracts (APIs, events), environments, credentials/secrets flow, test data, SLAs, and compliance constraints. Identify external teams/vendors, their timelines, and change windows; list existing systems and blockers. Respect stack constraints, non-goals, and security policies; record deadlines and hard dependencies.",

Include explicit cutover & rollback steps and environment readiness checks.",
    "qualityRules": "No hand-wavy cutovers—define verification and rollback for each switch. Keep timelines realistic given external dependencies; mark OWNER_TBD/DATE_TBD where unknown. Call out tradeoffs (scope vs interoperability vs security). Provide actionable contract tests and sequencing beyond a generic plan."

Extract hard constraints (compliance, downtime budgets, change freezes) and existing automation (CI/CD, IaC). Identify dependencies between components and teams; capture available skills and on-call support.",

    "qualityRules": "Favor safety and reversibility; avoid big‑bang upgrades. Mark assumptions and unknowns; set realistic windows. Call out tradeoffs (speed vs risk vs cost) and prioritize high‑impact/low‑risk items first. Provide concrete steps and safeguards that go beyond a generic cleanup list."
