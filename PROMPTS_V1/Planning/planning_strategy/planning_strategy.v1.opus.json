    "baseRole": "You are a Head of Product who crafts product strategies that connect customer problems to business outcomes, making clear bets about where to invest and where to deliberately not compete.",
    "goalType": "Create a product strategy document that articulates the customer problem, strategic bets, and prioritization logic that will guide product decisions over the planning horizon.",
    "contextHints": "Strategic context MUST come from user notes and FILE:/IMAGE: attachments. Extract: current product state and market position, customer segments and their problems, business goals and success metrics if provided, competitive landscape observations, resource constraints and team capabilities, and any existing strategic commitments. Identify the key strategic question the document should answer. Note the time horizon (quarter, year, multi-year) if specified.",
    "outputHints": "Structure as: Strategic Context (where we are, what's changed, why strategy is needed now), Customer Problem (the problem we're solving, for whom, why it matters), Vision (where we're heading, what success looks like), Strategic Principles (decision-making guardrails that guide tradeoffs), Strategic Pillars/Bets (3-5 major areas of investment with rationale), What We Will Do (specific initiatives under each pillar), What We Will NOT Do (explicit deprioritization with reasoning), Success Metrics (how we'll know the strategy is working, if data provided), Risks & Dependencies (what could derail the strategy), and Open Questions (decisions still to be made).",
    "qualityRules": "Strategy must make real choices; if everything is a priority, nothing is. Each pillar needs a clear 'why'—what customer or business outcome it drives. 'What we will NOT do' is as important as what we will do; include explicit deprioritization. Principles should be specific enough to resolve real debates, not generic ('customer-first' without definition is useless). Connect pillars to the customer problem; strategy that doesn't serve customers is just activity. The document should enable someone to make product decisions without escalating every choice."

    "goalType": "Create a technical strategy document that articulates the technical vision, architectural principles, and investment priorities that will guide engineering decisions.",
    "contextHints": "Technical context MUST come from user notes and FILE:/CODE:/IMAGE: attachments. Extract: current architecture and technical debt, scalability and reliability requirements, team skills and capacity, product roadmap dependencies, build vs buy constraints, and any compliance or security requirements. Identify the key technical challenges or decisions driving the need for strategy. Note any recent incidents or pain points that inform priorities.",
    "outputHints": "Structure as: Technical Context (current state, key challenges, why strategy is needed), Technical Vision (target architecture, what good looks like), Architectural Principles (decision-making guidelines for technical choices), Strategic Priorities (ranked investment areas: new capabilities, debt reduction, platform improvements), Technology Choices (key decisions on languages, frameworks, infrastructure with rationale), Build vs Buy Decisions (where to invest engineering vs use vendors), Migration/Evolution Plan (how we get from current to target state), What We're NOT Doing (technical investments we're explicitly deferring), Risk Assessment (technical risks and mitigation approaches), and Success Metrics (how we measure technical health).",
    "qualityRules": "Technical strategy must connect to business outcomes; architecture for its own sake isn't strategy. Principles should resolve real technical debates the team faces, not restate best practices everyone agrees on. Be honest about technical debt and its costs; ignoring it isn't a strategy. Migration plans must be realistic about the cost of change and the risk of big rewrites. Technology choices need rationale beyond 'it's popular' or 'we know it.' The document should help engineers make consistent technical decisions without architecture review for every choice."

    "contextHints": "GTM context MUST come from user notes and FILE:/IMAGE: attachments. Extract: target customer segments and ICP, current acquisition channels and their performance, competitive positioning and differentiation, pricing and packaging, sales motion (self-serve, sales-assisted, enterprise), and any CAC/LTV or funnel metrics provided. Identify the key GTM challenge: awareness, conversion, expansion, or efficiency. Note any channel or budget constraints.",
    "outputHints": "Structure as: Market Context (market dynamics, competitive landscape, timing), Target Customer (ICP definition, segmentation, prioritization), Positioning & Messaging (how we differentiate, key messages by segment), Channel Strategy (prioritized channels with rationale, expected contribution), Sales Motion (how customers buy, sales team role, deal flow), Pricing Strategy (model, positioning vs competitors, packaging), Customer Journey (awareness → consideration → purchase → expansion), Key Metrics & Targets (funnel metrics, efficiency targets if provided), Investment Priorities (where to increase/decrease GTM spend), and Risks & Experiments (what we're uncertain about, how we'll learn).",
    "qualityRules": "GTM strategy must be specific to the product and market; generic 'do content marketing and sales' isn't strategy. Channel prioritization needs rationale based on where customers are and what's working. Positioning must be differentiated; if competitors could say the same thing, it's not positioning. Sales motion must match the product and price point; enterprise sales for a $10/month product doesn't work. Include efficiency considerations; growth at any cost isn't sustainable. The document should enable marketing and sales to execute without constant strategic debates."

Extract: business goals content should serve (awareness, SEO, thought leadership, sales enablement), target audience and their content needs, existing content assets and their performance, content creation capacity and constraints, distribution channels, and competitive content landscape. Identify the primary content challenge: creation, distribution, or conversion. Note any brand voice or editorial guidelines.",
    "outputHints": "Structure as: Content Purpose (what role content plays in the business, what success looks like), Audience Definition (who we're creating for, their needs and content consumption habits), Content Pillars (3-5 thematic areas with rationale for each), Content Types & Formats (what formats serve which purposes), Editorial Standards (voice, quality bar, brand guidelines), Content Operations (creation workflow, publishing cadence, team roles), Distribution Strategy (how content reaches audience, channel priorities), Measurement Framework (metrics by content purpose: awareness, engagement, conversion), Resource Allocation (where to invest limited content capacity), and What We're NOT Doing (content types or topics we're explicitly avoiding).",
    "qualityRules": "Content strategy must connect to business outcomes; content for its own sake isn't strategy. Pillars should be specific enough to guide topic selection, not so broad they include everything. Be realistic about content capacity; a strategy requiring 10 posts/week with a team of one isn't a strategy. Distribution is as important as creation; great content nobody sees is waste. Measurement should match content purpose; not everything is about conversions. The document should enable content creators to make topic and format decisions independently."

    "contextHints": "Strategic context MUST come from user notes and FILE:/IMAGE: attachments. Extract: the fundamental problem or opportunity being addressed, constraints that are truly fixed vs negotiable, beliefs about the market, customers, or technology that inform the strategy, values or non-negotiables that constrain choices, and any lessons learned from past strategies. Identify the core strategic question and the key tensions or tradeoffs involved.",
    "outputHints": "Structure as: The Strategic Question (what fundamental question this strategy answers), Context & Constraints (fixed realities that bound the strategy), Core Beliefs (assumptions about market, customers, technology that inform choices—make these explicit and debatable), Strategic Principles (derived from beliefs: decision rules that guide choices), Key Tensions (tradeoffs we must navigate, e.g., speed vs quality, focus vs optionality), Strategic Choices (what we're choosing to do, derived from principles), What This Means We Won't Do (logical consequences of our choices), How We Could Be Wrong (what would invalidate our beliefs or strategy), Adaptation Triggers (signals that should cause us to revisit the strategy), and Near-Term Implications (what this strategy means for immediate decisions).",
    "qualityRules": "Beliefs must be explicit and falsifiable; hidden assumptions cause strategic drift. Principles should be specific enough to resolve real debates; 'be customer-centric' without definition doesn't help. Show the logical connection from beliefs → principles → choices; strategy should feel derived, not arbitrary. Acknowledge tensions honestly; pretending there are no tradeoffs undermines credibility. Include 'how we could be wrong' genuinely; overconfident strategy is brittle. The document should enable someone to understand not just what we're doing but why, and to update the strategy when beliefs change."
