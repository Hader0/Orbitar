    "goalType": "Turn the user’s context into a clear, actionable product strategy with priorities, tradeoffs, and guardrails that drive roadmap focus.",
    "contextHints": "Mine FILE:/IMAGE: for current situation (users, segments, problems), goals/OKRs and time horizons, active initiatives, and constraints (team, budget, tech). Pull user research, win/loss notes, and feedback themes; keep geography and product scope as provided. Do NOT invent metrics or goals—quote them or mark as ASSUMPTION if user requests illustrative placeholders.",
    "outputHints": "Structure the doc as: 1) Context & problem, 2) Goals & success metrics (as provided; mark UNKNOWN if missing), 3) Principles / guardrails (what quality bar and boundaries apply), 4) Strategic pillars / bets (3–5 pillars tied to customer outcomes), 5) What we will do (and will NOT do) with rationale, 6) Risks and open questions, 7) Next steps & decision checkpoints. Use an objectives → pillars → initiatives mapping; include ‘Now / Next / Later’ for each pillar if helpful.",
    "qualityRules": "Ground every point in the user’s materials; avoid generic slogans. Make tradeoffs explicit—do not list everything as P1. Separate strategy (what/why) from execution (how), but provide next-step guidance. Do not fabricate numbers; label assumptions clearly. Exceed a 10‑second prompt with a principled structure that connects goals to pillars and explicit do/do‑not calls."

    "contextHints": "From FILE:/IMAGE:, extract current architecture, reliability/cost targets, tech constraints, backlog themes, and existing bets. Include any SLAs/SLOs only if provided; otherwise mark as UNKNOWN or ASSUMPTION if the user requests placeholders. Capture time horizons and dependencies on teams or vendors.",
    "outputHints": "Produce: 1) Context & problem (current platform limits, risks), 2) Goals & success metrics (SLO/cost/velocity as provided), 3) Principles / guardrails (e.g., paved roads, ownership, security), 4) Strategic pillars (e.g., observability, platform APIs, data foundations, infra modernization), 5) Will / Will NOT do (tech choices, deprecations), 6) Risks & open questions, 7) Now / Next / Later (capabilities unlocked, decision gates). Include a short dependency map to inform sequencing.",
    "qualityRules": "Do not invent targets; quote or mark UNKNOWN/ASSUMPTION. Articulate tradeoffs (cost vs reliability vs speed). Keep the strategy level at ‘what/why’ while pointing to enabling capabilities. Ensure recommendations are realistic for the stack/constraints. Clearly surpass a generic prompt with guardrails and staged capability bets."

Tie each pillar to specific evidence from attachments.",
    "qualityRules": "No fabricated metrics, customers, or pricing details. Make tradeoffs explicit (coverage vs focus; paid vs content). Keep strategy distinct from full execution plans yet provide testable next steps. Ground positioning and channel choices in provided context. Outperform a generic prompt via pillars linked to ICP and a sequenced test plan."

Include a lightweight content matrix (theme × format × channel) tied to objectives.",
    "qualityRules": "Avoid generic content advice; ground themes and channels in provided audience/brand data. State tradeoffs (depth vs frequency; breadth vs focus). Keep strategy high‑level but actionable with cadence and ownership hints. No fabricated performance numbers. Clearly better than a generic prompt via pillars, guardrails, and a durable calendar structure."

Keep strategy at the ‘what/why’ level while pointing to proofs and references to acquire. Provide a sharper, more grounded output than a generic prompt through explicit guardrails and competitive pillars."
